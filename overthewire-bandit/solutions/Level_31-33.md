Level 31:

Given:
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

We did the same steps as previous levels to clone the repo
in the level we have this :
```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/bandit_31_ran/repo$ cat README.md 
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

```

we have to push this key.txt file 

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/bandit_31_ran/repo$ cat key.txt 
May I come in?bandit31@bandit:/tmp/bandit_31_ran/repo$ git add -f key.txt 
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/bandit_31_ran/repo$ git commit -m 'Added key.txt'
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!

At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly working
on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!
bandit33@bandit:~$
