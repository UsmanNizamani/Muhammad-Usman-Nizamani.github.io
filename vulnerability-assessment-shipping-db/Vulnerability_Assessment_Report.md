#  Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Scenario

You are a new cybersecurity analyst at a global shipping company. The company uses a central database server to manage important business data. During your review, you found that this database server is **publicly accessible from the internet**, with **no proper security controls**. This means that **anyone** on the internet could try to connect to it — which is a serious risk.

---

##  Step 1: Purpose

This report was created to review and improve the security of the company’s MySQL database server. This server is very important because it handles shipping records, customer info, and supplier data. If someone hacked or damaged it, the company could lose money, stop operations, or face legal trouble. The goal is to find security problems and suggest ways to fix them so the server stays safe and the business runs smoothly.

##  Step 2: Identify Potential Threat Sources

Here are three common sources of threats that could cause harm to the server:

| Threat Source      | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **External Attackers** | Hackers trying to break in from the internet to steal or damage data. |
| **Insider Threats**     | Employees or staff who accidentally or intentionally mess with settings or data. |
| **Malware/Ransomware** | Harmful software that could lock or delete data if it infects the server. |

---

##  Step 3: Identify Potential Threat Events

Based on those threat sources, here’s what could happen:

| Threat Source       | What Could Happen                                                             |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| External Attackers  | They could break in using weak security settings and steal or delete data. |
| Insider Threats     | Someone inside might misconfigure the server and expose sensitive data. |
| Malware/Ransomware  | The server might get infected, locking the data or asking for ransom. |

##  Step 4: Risk Assessment

We rated how likely each event is and how bad it would be if it happened. Then we calculated a risk score:

- **Likelihood (1-3)**: How likely is it to happen?  
- **Severity (1-3)**: How bad would it be?  
- **Risk Score = Likelihood × Severity**

| Threat Source       | Threat Event                                        | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| External Attackers  | Break in via internet and steal/delete data         | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Insider Threats     | Misconfiguring the server or exposing data          | 2          | 3        | 6    |
| Malware/Ransomware  | Server infected and data locked                     | 2          | 3        | 6    |

##  Approach

This assessment uses **qualitative judgment**, meaning we made educated guesses based on security knowledge and experience. We focused on the three biggest threats: external hackers, insider mistakes, and malware. These are common problems for public-facing systems and could cause serious damage to the company. Identifying these risks helps the company understand where to focus its security efforts.

---

##  Remediation Strategy

To reduce the risk, the company should:

- **Limit Access (Least Privilege)**: Only allow people access to what they need to do their jobs.
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require users to verify their identity with more than just a password.
- **Add Multiple Layers of Protection (Defense in Depth)**: Use firewalls, security software, system updates, and monitoring to block threats.
- **Train Staff & Monitor Access**: Make sure staff follow security best practices and monitor for unusual behavior.

These steps will help stop attacks before they happen and make the system much harder to break into.
